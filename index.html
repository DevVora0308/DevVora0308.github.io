								<h3><a href="https://github.com/DevVora0308/Elective-Course-Allotment.git">Elective Course Allotment</a></h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Designed a web application for online allotment for the various courses provided by the Institute
								or an organization to students as per the choices previously filled by students.
								This Web Application was developed using PHP and PHPMyadmin. 
								Using a program of random allocation based on various filters and taking into account the various choices provided by the student the allocation takes place. 
								The first choice of every student is checked then the availability of seats is checked and if there is availability the seat is allotted to that particular student. 
								The emails of the allotted seats are sent using the phpmailer software

							</header><br>
							<p>
								Developed a website called House-Helpers which focusses on providing household services and help like Salon, Massage, 
								Housekeeping, Trainer, Electrical Appliances and Plumbing repairs. It was developed using Django and hosted on Heroku. 
								This is a Django project done by me and my group. The website idea is similar to UrbanClap where 
								household services are provided by helpers and professionals and all of it is coordinated online.
								I used Django, Python, Html, CSS, Bootstrap for developing the website.

								<h3>Internship 3</h3><br>
								<h3><a href="https://github.com/DevVora0308/EXAM-ALLOCATION">Exam Duty Allocation</a></h3>
							</header><br>
							<p>Designed a web application for online service and help in the allocation of duty to faculty during exams. 
								This web application was developed using PHP. I have used Google Signin Api to allow professors to login through their college ID.
								In this system, the faculty gets allocated for a particular exam according to his/her leave status and appropriate constraints. 
								<br><br>The emails are sent through a PHP mailer. Made front-end responsive using Bootstrap.
								To design a system for assigning faculty during the examination, it would be random allocation as per the attendance status of a particular faculty.

								<p>
									A review paper on how Social Engineering Attacks are carried out and the objective behind such attacks. 
									The various kinds of attacks explored were Phishing, Smishing, Pretexting, Baiting, etc. along with the attack surfaces. 
									Detailed reasoning why humans are the weakest links in this whole cyber network is provided along with ML-based and Software-based solutions.
									This paper aims to bring into light the different methods and techniques employed by the cyber attackers and criminals tocommit cybercrimes and harass the victims. 
									It discusses thevarious kinds of attacks that can lead an individual to fall prey to the attackers, why humans are a weak link in cyber-attacks,the various counter-measures available and the role of AI, MLand in preventing these attacks

									<h3><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355845165_Car_Image_Classification_and_Recognition">Car Image Classification and Recognition</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Vehicle positioning and classification is a vital technology in intelligent transportation and self-driving cars. 
									This paper describes the experimentation for the classification of vehicle images by artificial vision using Keras and TensorFlow to construct a deep neural network model, Python modules, as well as a machine learning algorithm. Image classification finds its suitability in applications ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous vehicles. 
									The existing architectures are computationally exhaustive, complex, and less accurate. The outcomes are used to assess the best camera location for filming, and the vehicular traffic to determine the highway occupancy. 
									An accurate, simple, and hardware-efficient architecture is required to be developed for image classification.

								</header>
								<p>
									ReLis is a smart e-library system that is eco-friendly as it uses soft copies and thus, it saves paper. 
									This platform allows users to search books using specific keywords, titles, author names,  genres, etc.  
									Also, this platform has a user-friendly interface, allows users to buy, rent, and publish books, and also can upload the book in pdf format.  
									The platform also provides graphical statistics based on the user's reading history. 
									The user would get a personalized experience by the addition of a recommendation feature using collaborative filtering.
									Based on the current scenario, screen time for most people has increased drastically which causes negative effects on our body, and thus the feature of audiobooks is beneficial to users.
